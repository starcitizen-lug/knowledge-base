## Runners
Some of our members build wine runners tailored specifically for Star Citizen.

### Raw_FoX

## Installation
If you use Lutris, you can use the [LUG Helper](https://github.com/starcitizen-lug/lug-helper) to manage your wine runners or manually install them:

* Put the runner download in `~/.local/share/lutris/runners/wine/` and restart Lutris
* In Lutris game configuration select the extracted runner from the pulldown menu

If you do not use Lutris, you can use the Wine build as follows:

* Put the download in a directory of your choice, for example, `~/Downloads/lug-sc-wine`
* Use `~/Downloads/your-runner/bin/wine` as Wine executable for running the game / installer.
