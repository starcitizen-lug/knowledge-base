# ðŸ¤ª Unexpected Behavior


## Empty launcher
- Try logging out and back in, or reset the launcher by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Alt+R
- Wine >=10.17 may cause launcher rendering issues. The launcher may be empty or only show the background video, music may work, and buttons are invisible.
  - Use the [LUG Helper](/Tips-and-Tricks#how-to-add-a-wine-runner) to install a LUG-Wine runner `10.16` or `10.15`.
- If using the Cosmic DE beta, this is a [known issue](https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic-epoch/issues/2368). Try using the [LUG Helper](/Tips-and-Tricks#how-to-run-the-lug-helper)'s `Open Wine prefix configuration` option in the Maintenance menu to turn on virtual desktop mode.


## Launch Error - Settings.json not found
- Verify game files

## Launch Error - %AppData% returned empty string
- Open a [Wine maintenance shell](/Tips-and-Tricks#how-to-get-a-wine-maintenance-shell-using-the-launch-script) then type `wineserver -k` to terminate all lingering Wine processes.
- If that doesn't resolve it, try switching to a different Wine runner.
- Check that you havenâ€™t changed the default install path in the RSI Launcher settings.


## Visual glitches or semi-transparent lines, poor performance, possibly random crashes
- DXVK may be broken or disabled. Reinstall it using the LUG Helper DXVK and maintenance menus
- Your game shader cache may need to be cleared. Use the Delete Shaders option in the RSI Launcher > Settings > Games > {LIVE,PTU} > Delete Local Settings > Shaders folder


## Account login failed (possible code 19000)
This is a generic error code representing any issue with logging in to CIG servers
- Expected when attempting launch/login during a patch release
- Kill the launcher and restart it and try again
- Ensure that IPv6 is not disabled


## Required Vulkan Extensions are missing error / poor performance compared to windows / error code 3
- Check if you have amdvlk installed by running `vulkaninfo --summary`. The vulkaninfo utility is part of the package `vulkan-tools` on most distros. You can also check your package manager.
- If your system is using amdvlk, uninstall that package and replace it with `vulkan-radeon`.
- For additional help with this, ask in our [Discord](/) tech support channel.


## DirectX error message
- Error may read `Star Citizen requires DirectX feature level of 11.1 as a minimum which is not supported at present on this machine`

- Check that the `Vulkan device` is not set to an integrated gpu (ie, Intel)
  - identify device name using command `vulkaninfo --summary | grep deviceName`
  - set device name with environment variable `DXVK_FILTER_DEVICE_NAME=yourdevicenamehere`
  - verify by setting environment variable `DXVK_HUD=1` and observing the device name in the upper left of the screen
- Also make sure your GPU drivers (Mesa/nvidia) are up to date and DXVK is enabled/updated.
  - Use the LUG Helper to update dxvk
  - For AMD, be sure to use the open source radeon drivers (ie. vulkan-radeon), **not** the proprietary drivers (ie. amdvlk)
- Try switching to a non-staging wine runner from our [recommended runners](/Tips-and-Tricks#recommended-runners) list
- Try [downgrading](/Tips-and-Tricks#updating-dxvk-within-a-wine-prefix) to an older DXVK version


## Failed to initialize dependencies error
- Make sure the `SDL_VIDEODRIVER` environment variable is **NOT** set globally to `wayland` on your system: `env | grep SDL_VIDEODRIVER`
- If it is set, remove it from whichever environment config(s) is setting it.
- [Edit the launch script](#how-to-edit-the-launch-script) and add `unset SDL_VIDEODRIVER` to the environment variables section


## Black or flickering window, possible crash with errors 15006 or 30007
- Check for larger resolutions and scaling settings.  See CIG's [support article](https://support.robertsspaceindustries.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000081887-Guide-to-Graphic-Issues#large-res)


## Black/transparent window after clicking 'Launch'
- Check our [latest news](/#news) for gpu driver issues, necessary workarounds, and currently recommended runner/DXVK versions.
- Make sure DXVK is installed and enabled


## Launcher crashes/hangs after entering login info when running Niri WM and/or xwayland-satellite
- See [upstream issue report](https://github.com/Supreeeme/xwayland-satellite/issues/189)
- Workarounds: Use xwayland-run, [gamescope](/Tips-and-Tricks#gamescope), an alternative to xwayland-satellite, or an alternative compositor.
